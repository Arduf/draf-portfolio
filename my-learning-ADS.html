        <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="Campaign_img.png" class="img-fluid rounded mb-4" alt="Campaign Image">
            <figcaption class="mt-2">This campaign wasn't bid on because it was created for keyword research...</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3 class="text-center mb-4 animate__animated animate__slideInUp">Keyword Research</h3>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__slideInUp" style="text-align: justify;">I used SemRush and Google Keyword Planner to define the relevant keywords for my product. The board match type is the crucial match type to jumpstart the campaign because I want to receive as much data insight as possible to analyze which keywords are best performing and which keywords are worst performing in order to create the negative keywords list for this campaign. However, the importance of negative keywords was considered, such as specific product brand, free, discount, etc., due to the fact that I want to prevent overspending on irrelevant keywords with my products.

          Here's a smoother version of your paragraph while keeping your intended meaning: Next, after obtaining the data insights, I create an A/B testing ad group. This allows me to use the gathered information to select the most promising keywords and assign them to the appropriate ad group. I then track and test each ad to identify which ones perform better. The top-performing keywords are moved to the conversion ad group, where I can further optimize them for the best possible results. This process helps me refine my campaign strategy, ensuring that I'm using the most effective keywords and ads to achieve my marketing goals.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- A/B Testing -->
    <section class="container section-heading border rounded-4 shadow-sm p-4 mb-4 bg-white text-black">

        </figure>
        <h3 class="text-center mb-4 animate__animated animate__slideInUp">A/B Testing</h3>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__slideInUp" style="text-align: justify;">
          A/B testing is crucial for determining which ad group performs better in terms of conversions or impressions, depending on the test's objective. To begin, I launch a jumpstart ad to gather initial data insights. Then, I analyze this data, focusing on elements like keywords, ad copy, CPC, and bidding strategies. The insights gained from A/B testing serve as a valuable guide for future campaigns, allowing me to fine-tune my approach. This process helps me tailor my campaigns to reach my target audience more effectively.

    <!-- Conversion Tracking -->
    <section class="container section-heading">
        <div class="border rounded-4 shadow-sm p-4 mb-4 bg-white text-black">
            <h3 class="text-center mb-4 animate__animated animate__slideInUp">Conversion Tracking</h3>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__slideInUp" style="text-align: justify;">Conversion data is crucial for various reasons, including remarketing, product improvement, and tailoring promotions. I've set up Google Analytics on my website and linked it to my Google Ads account to track ad clicks. Additionally, I've created a conversion ad group to monitor users who submit their contact information for promotions. This allows me to collect emails for remarketing to cart abandoners using the MailPoet plugin in WordPress. By focusing on these conversion metrics, I can optimize my marketing strategy and improve customer engagement.
            <br>
            <br>The conversion value is very important data that I can calculate with the cost of ads to determine the actual profitability of advertising efforts. In a similar way is the calculation of ROAS because the conversion value is the parameter that I can use to calculate the ROAS.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border rounded-4 shadow-sm p-4 mb-4 bg-white text-black">
            <h3 class="text-center mb-4 animate__animated animate__slideInUp">Bidding Strategies (Maximized CPC)</h3>
            <p class="animate__animated animate__slideInUp" style="text-align: justify;">The insights from conversion rate data are crucial for optimizing Cost Per Click (CPC). This data helps me calculate the maximum CPC for our ad group, which determines the actual cost paid to Google Ads. Google Ads offers various bidding options like manual CPC, Enhanced CPC (ECPC), and Cost Per Acquisition (CPA), each suited to different campaign objectives. Choosing the right bidding strategy is key to achieving targets without overspending. Additionally, Max CPC influences ad rank, affecting where ads appear on search result pages. It's important to note that the landing page quality score is a significant factor in this calculation, making it a critical element to consider in the overall advertising strategy.</p>
